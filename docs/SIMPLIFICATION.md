# Search System Design

## Current Implementation

The search system uses a Chrome extension-based indexing approach with Japanese language support, parallel processing, and incremental updates for optimal performance.

## Key Design Decisions

### Chrome Extension Integration
- **Pre-built indexes** created by Chrome extension
- **Native messaging host** for bidirectional communication
- **Read-only access** to extension-created indexes
- No server-side content fetching needed

### Performance Optimizations (v0.4.3)
- **Parallel indexing** with 5-10x speed improvement
- **Concurrent tab processing** - up to 5 tabs simultaneously
- **Smart concurrency** - sequential for 1-2 bookmarks, parallel for 3+
- **Batch processing** - 50 bookmarks per commit for optimal memory usage
- **Single message protocol** - all bookmarks sent in one message to reduce overhead

### Incremental Updates (v0.4.2)
- **Content hashing** to detect changes
- **Skip unchanged bookmarks** during re-indexing
- **Metadata tracking** with indexed timestamps
- Re-indexing time reduced from ~50 seconds to ~1 second for unchanged content
- Smart differential updates only process modified bookmarks

### Japanese Language Support
- **Lindera tokenizer** for proper Japanese text segmentation
- **UTF-8 safe** text processing
- Works seamlessly with English content
- Automatic language detection
- Supports Japanese phrases in quoted searches

### Multi-Index Search (v0.4.1)
- **Parallel search** across multiple indices
- **Comma-separated INDEX_NAME** configuration
- **URL deduplication** with score-based merging
- Efficient result aggregation from multiple sources

### Phrase Search (v0.4.1)
- **Quoted queries** for exact phrase matching
- **Mixed queries** - combine phrases and individual words
- **Japanese phrase support** with proper tokenization
- **Special character handling** in phrases

### Index-First Strategy
The `get_bookmark_content` tool follows this approach:
1. Check if content exists in Chrome extension index
2. Return indexed content directly
3. No web fetching - all content pre-indexed

## Search Tools Behavior

### search_bookmarks
- Searches bookmark titles and URLs only
- Fast metadata-based search
- Always available immediately

### search_bookmarks_fulltext  
- Full-text search through page content
- Returns `content_snippet` and `has_full_content` fields
- Includes indexing status in response
- Supports folder and domain filtering
- Handles phrase searches with quoted terms
- Can search across multiple indices simultaneously

### get_indexing_status
- Shows current indexing progress
- Indicates completion status
- Displays incremental update statistics
- Helps users understand search readiness

## Performance Timeline

| Time | Operation | Performance |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 0s | Initial setup | Instant |
| 1-5s | Index 100 bookmarks | Parallel processing (5-10x faster) |
| 10-30s | Index 1000 bookmarks | Batch processing with progress tracking |
| <1s | Re-index unchanged content | Skip via content hashing |
| <100ms | Search query | Tantivy full-text search |
| <200ms | Multi-index search | Parallel execution |

## Indexing Performance Comparison

| Bookmarks | Sequential | Parallel | Improvement |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| 10 | 50s | 10s | 5x |
| 50 | 250s | 30s | 8.3x |
| 100 | 500s | 50s | 10x |
| 500 | 2500s | 250s | 10x |

## User Experience Features

### Smart Processing
- **Adaptive concurrency** - adjusts based on bookmark count
- **Progress tracking** - real-time updates for large collections
- **Error recovery** - retry failed bookmarks with exponential backoff
- **Memory management** - batched commits prevent memory overflow

### Incremental Intelligence
- **Change detection** - only process modified bookmarks
- **Content hashing** - reliable change tracking
- **Metadata persistence** - maintains index state across sessions
- **Fast re-indexing** - sub-second for unchanged content

## Benefits

- **Instant availability** - All content pre-indexed by Chrome extension
- **5-10x faster indexing** - Parallel tab processing
- **Incremental updates** - Only changed content re-indexed
- **Multi-language support** - Japanese tokenization with Lindera
- **Advanced search** - Phrase search and multi-index capabilities
- **Zero latency** - No runtime content fetching
- **Better reliability** - No network dependencies
- **Simplified architecture** - Read-only index access
- **Scalable** - Handles thousands of bookmarks efficiently
